# FEND P5: Restaurant Reviews App - stage 1


## Overview
This is a 5th project of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree (FEND). Converting a given static webpage to a **mobile-ready** web application.

## Project (Stage 1) Requirements
1. **Responsive Design**
* Convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays.
* All of the page elements should be usable and visible in any viewport, including desktop, tablet, and mobile displays.
* Images shouldn't overlap, and page elements should wrap when the viewport is too small to display them side by side.

2. **A11y**
* Using web accessibillity, ensure that `alt` attributes are present and descriptive for images.
* Add screen-reader-only attributes when appropriate to add useful supplementary text.
* Use semantic markup where possible, and aria attributes when semantic markup is not feasible.

3. **Offline Use**
* Using Cache API and a ServiceWorker, cache the data for the website so that any page (including images) that has been visited is accessible offline.
